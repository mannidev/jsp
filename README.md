# JAVA
A simple app to demonstrate how to process a client request using a servlet and jsp.

The the servlet reveives the request and forwards the request to a jsp to handle the output display.

##### What we will learn
- set request attributes using `req.setAttribute()`
- get contents of a request attribute in jsp
- forward requests from a servlet to a jsp using `req.getRequestDispatcher()` and `forward()`
